Emotion recognition and sentiment analysis for CMU-MOSEI dataset
The original repo is from ["A Transformer-based joint-encoding for Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis"](https://github.com/jbdel/MOSEI_UMONS)

What's more, here add two cascade self-attention model pipeline in the model. Here I just put the model here, which can run in the original repo.
